                                <h1 id="http-codes">HTTP Codes</h1>
<p>The problem with http codes is, that there are lot more then only the two or three commonly used ones like 404, 200 and 500. I have seen apis and projects working on these codes only, implementing custom response handling, departing from their own handling all over the whole project.</p>
<p>If http codes are implemented properly, things get a lot more comfortable. I take you on a small trip which codes are necessary, which are useful and where they should be used.</p>
<h2 id="1xx-codes">1xx Codes</h2>
<p>Never used one of these in any of my applications / apis. There is one I would like to mention. Generally the 1xx section is used for information about a request during the call itself.</p>
<h3 id="102-processing">102 Processing</h3>
<p>Should be used if the you do not want to have a timeout in the request, but the processing needs very long time.</p>
<h2 id="2xx-success">2xx Success</h2>
<p>Telling the client that request is processed properly and results are returned</p>
<h3 id="200-ok">200 OK</h3>
<p>Everything went fine, checkout response body to see what you got.</p>
<h3 id="204-no-content">204 No Content</h3>
<p>Request was successful but the response does NOT have a body (on purpose).</p>
<h3 id="206-partial-content">206 Partial Content</h3>
<p>Useful if you are sending large content, e.g. video or something that loads in chunks.</p>
<h2 id="redirections">Redirections</h2>
<p>Some useful codes if your resource can be found somewhere else (even in clients cache)</p>
<h3 id="301-moved-permanently">301 Moved Permanently</h3>
<p>Resource is permanently moved to another location. Typically contains a <code>Location</code> header that indicates the new URL to the resource. Client should not come back here.</p>
<h3 id="302-found-moved-temporarily">302 Found (Moved Temporarily)</h3>
<p>Resource is temporarily moved to another location. Typically contains a <code>Location</code> header that indicates the new URL to the resource.</p>
<h3 id="304-not-modified">304 Not Modified</h3>
<p>Resource is not modified, compared to an old response. Never use this one on idempotent requests! Check out the chapter about <a href="08_idempotency_concurrency.md">idempotency</a></p>
<h3 id="307-temporary-redirect">307 Temporary Redirect</h3>
<p>Used for the same reason as 302, but ensures the client that the same method and body will be used to perform the request.</p>
<h3 id="308-permanent-redirect">308 Permanent Redirect</h3>
<p>Used for the same reason as 301, but ensures the client that the same method and body will be used to perform the request.</p>
<h2 id="client-errors">Client Errors</h2>
<p>Let the client know that the sent request was not correct. Not being correct can mean a lot of things...</p>
<h3 id="400-bad-request">400 Bad Request</h3>
<p>General error message for a request that is syntactically not correct. This is by far the most miss-used code the world has ever seen. Its not the <code>swiss-army-knife-code-for-everything-that-did-not-work</code>!</p>
<h3 id="401-unauthorized">401 Unauthorized</h3>
<p>Request is not authenticated and tries to access a secured resource or method.</p>
<h3 id="403-forbidden">403 Forbidden</h3>
<p>If you want to let the client know, that this resource is there but it does not have sufficient permissions to perform that method on this resource.</p>
<h3 id="404-not-found">404 Not Found</h3>
<p>When a resource is not found. I guess you know this one pretty well. I tend to use this only if I have an authenticated request. For anonymous requests I like to hide any information an possible attacker is able to use against or crawl you.</p>
<h3 id="405-method-not-allowed">405 Method not Allowed</h3>
<p>When a method, maybe POST an a resource is called that does exist (the method, not the resource).</p>
<h3 id="412-precondition-failed">412 Precondition Failed</h3>
<p>If something else must have happened before this request can be completed successfully, e.g. another transaction.</p>
<h3 id="413-entity-too-large">413 Entity Too Large</h3>
<p>The sent payload is too large. Could be used when receiving an image via POST that is larger (in meaning of data volume, not pixels...) then defined.</p>
<h3 id="415-unsupported-media-type">415 Unsupported Media Type</h3>
<p>When you try to request (receive or send) a content type that is not offered by the api, like you want to post xml content to an api that only consumes json.</p>
<h3 id="422-unprocessable-entity">422 Unprocessable Entity</h3>
<p>The request itself was formatted correctly but something with the entity is not working properly. Can be used to identify invalid content in a body for instance.</p>
<h3 id="429-too-many-requests">429 Too Many Requests</h3>
<p>Typically used when you throttle your api to let clients perform only a specific amount of requests in a time frame.</p>
<h2 id="server-errors">Server Errors</h2>
<p>These types mean that something broke on servers side - you do not want your users to see these frequently. But DO NOT USE 4xx for these. Clients need to know if their requests was correct.</p>
<h3 id="500-internal-server-error">500 Internal Server Error</h3>
<p>Maybe some uncaught exception....</p>
<h3 id="502-bad-gateway">502 Bad Gateway</h3>
<p>Well, never need to use this before, but it can identify problems with apis (servers) upstream, e.g. a further request could not have been performed and api informs client about this situation.</p>
<h3 id="503-service-unavailable">503 Service Unavailable</h3>
<p>Let the clients know that this resource is currently not alive (overload, booting, etc.) but add a <code>retry-after</code> header (with sufficiently high random time frames)</p>
