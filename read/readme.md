# restfool

This is the approach to aggregate all the vital information about restful apis that crossed my way. The name came up when reading all the (dangerous) superficial knowledge that crossed my way as many times. Not only in the web, even in jobs having discussions with colleagues about untruth. I try to keep myself up to using some academical way of putting my references in here, too.

## structure
***(the play part is moved to separate branch right now)***
Restfool is planned as two things. One is to have some textual content in the `read` section and the other is kind of playground where you have a less literal way of consuming the lessons i have learned. Another section planned is `play` where things can be tried using a little sandbox.


# read
Ok, where to start. Maybe some kind of table of contents might be nice. I belong to the tldr guys so I want you to have a quick way to dig into stuff.
