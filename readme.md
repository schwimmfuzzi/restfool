# restfool

This is the approach to aggregate all the vital information about restful apis that crossed my way. The name came up when reading all the (dangerous) superficial knowledge that crossed my way as many times. Not only in the web, even in jobs having discussions with colleagues about untruth. I try to keep myself up to using some academical way of putting my references in here, too.

## structure
Restfool is planned as two things. One is to have some textual content in the `read` section and the other is kind of playground where you have a less literal way of consuming the lessons i have learned. Another section planned is `play` where things can be tried using a little sandbox.
