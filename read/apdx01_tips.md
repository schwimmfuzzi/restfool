# Bringing Back Verbs
You remember the section in the beginning about nouns and verbs, and why not to use verbs? There is some way you can bring back verbs - a little bit. If you desperately need something like `send email`, just bring this as property into the model. Lets say you have an resource `email`. Then you can place the flag to indicate sending or not into the resource itself: `email.sendMail` can be true when the client makes a POST or PUT request. When the api process the update it can look for exactly this property and fire the mail stuff. When the resource is saved you definitely should look to revert this thing flag to its default value. A GET request on a resource that has some of this verb-workaround-properties, you could filter them (if you do not want to expose it to the client). The email example might not be the best one, but I think you get what I want to emphasize here.

# Process Like Seeing Things
Verbs can be interpreted as steps in a process. If you model a verb as part of a process you suddenly end up using nouns (and resources) again. Sending an email is just patch-ing and upadted process step to the resource.
